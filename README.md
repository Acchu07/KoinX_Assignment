FAQ

1. Why Current Node.js Version and Not LTS?
I just wanted to utilize Typescript without spending too much time debugging the setup. Similar to how deno utilizes it natively unfortunately compared to LTS the Current Node.js Version has better support for Typescript. In short less debugging to get TS running compared to the LTS version.

2. Why not Hono instead of Express?
Seems like Hono would have been more optimal for this assignment but I wanted to utilize Express for this assignment as it is more familiar to me and Typescript is something new for me. I didnt want to stack an additional layer of complexity on top of TS.

3. Docker?
Might Utilize Docker once Worker-Server is completed. TBD as it is easier setup for other people

4. Video File?
Might Add One of the working functionalities/Tasks As a Video File but that is TBD as of Right Now

5. Why TypeScript? Couldn't You Have Completed it faster if you built it with just Javascript
Well yes but compile time checking and static typing is something i prefer but preferences aside typescript has several more advantages and it seems like a valuable skillset to have the earlier the better and right now i am building familiarity.
