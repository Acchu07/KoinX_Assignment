FAQ

1. Why Current Node.js Version and Not LTS?

I chose the Current Node.js version because it has better native TypeScript support than LTS, reducing setup time and debuggingâ€”close to Deno.

2. Why not Hono instead of Express?

Hono may be more optimal, but I chose Express because I'm already familiar with it. Since TypeScript is new to me, I wanted to avoid adding extra complexity.

3. Docker?

Might Update with Docker Files - TBD

4. Why TypeScript? Couldn't You Have Completed it faster if you built it with just Javascript

Yes, JavaScript would be faster, but I prefer TypeScript for compile-time checks and static typing. Beyond preference, it's a valuable skill, and I'm building familiarity early.
