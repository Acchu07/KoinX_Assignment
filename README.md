FAQ

0. Video?
    Included two webm video files of the respective tasks having working functionalities.

1. Deployment?
    Atlas - On Hold Might deploy DB.
    Backend - Used up my free Railway plan. Recharge my railway account with 5$ and i will deploy both the db and the backend there. True Story

2. Why Current Node.js Version and Not LTS?

    I chose the Current Node.js version because it has better native TypeScript support than LTS, reducing setup time and debuggingâ€”close to Deno.

3. Why not Hono instead of Express?

    Hono may be more optimal, but I chose Express because I'm already familiar with it. Since TypeScript is new to me, I wanted to avoid adding extra complexity.

4. Docker?

    Might Update with Docker Files - TBD

5. Why TypeScript? Couldn't You Have Completed it faster if you built it with just Javascript

    Yes, JavaScript would be faster, but I prefer TypeScript for compile-time checks and static typing. Beyond preference, it's a valuable skill, and I'm building familiarity. If deno was an option instead of node i would have saved a lot of setting up and debugging why my ts is throwing an error or not working as intended time
